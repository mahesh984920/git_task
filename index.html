    <h1>DEVARA (2024)</h1>
    <hr>
    <P><h3>Summary :</h3></P>
    <p>Part 1 is a 2024 Indian Telugu-language action drama film[5] written and directed by Koratala Siva and produced by Yuvasudha Arts and N. T. R. Arts. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr in dual roles, alongside Saif Ali Khan, Janhvi Kapoor, Prakash Raj, Srikanth and Shine Tom Chacko. The film marks the Telugu cinema debut of Khan and Kapoor. The plot follows Devara (Rao), chieftain of a coastal village who is engaged in bloody feud with his counterpart Bhaira (Khan) over smuggling. The conflict, which starts as a personal vendetta, quickly escalates into a much larger power play that threatens to disrupt the entire region.

        The film was officially announced in April 2021 under the tentative title NTR30, as it is Rama Rao's 30th film as a lead actor, and the official title was announced in May 2023. In late-2023, the film was split into two-parts. Principal photography for this part commenced in April 2023 and wrapped in August 2024. Filming took place in Hyderabad, Shamshabad, Visakhapatnam, Goa and Thailand. The film has music composed by Anirudh Ravichander, with cinematography handled by R. Rathnavelu and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad respectively</p>
